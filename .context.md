# Developer Reliability Score API

## Overview
FastAPI backend scoring energy project developers based on interconnection queue track records.

## Key Files
- `app/scoring.py` — Weighted composite scoring model (0-100)
- `app/database.py` — DuckDB queries for developer metrics
- `app/routers/developers.py` — All API endpoints
- `data/init_db.py` — ETL script: queue.db → developers.duckdb

## Data Pipeline
Source: `queue-analysis-project/tools/.data/queue.db` (SQLite, 35K projects)
→ DuckDB with `projects` + `developers` tables (pre-computed metrics + scores)
→ 958 scored developers (5+ resolved outcomes required)

## Scoring Weights
Completion 30%, Timeline 20%, Volume 15%, Breadth 10%, Diversity 10%, Pipeline 10%, Depth 5%

## Auth
X-API-Key header, keys from API_KEYS env var (comma-separated)
